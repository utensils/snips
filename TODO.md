# UI/UX Rehabilitation Backlog (Settings Screenshot Audit)
- [x] Produce a design teardown of the current Settings UI (see `~/Pictures/2025-10-26-120221_hyprshot.png`): document hierarchy, color, spacing, and typography issues in `docs/ui-audit.md` with annotated screenshots and native GNOME/Adwaita comparables. _(Initial teardown recorded in `docs/ui-audit.md`; screenshot references captured, next step is annotated visuals.)_
- [x] Define a Linux-native component spec covering surface levels, stroke styles, radii, shadows, and spacing scales (12px/16px/24px) in `docs/ui-spec.md`; align tokens with Omarchy palettes instead of neon outlines. _(Spec outlined with color/spacing tokens and component inventory in `docs/ui-spec.md`.)_
- [x] Establish a reusable layout scaffold (`Surface`, `Sidebar`, `ContentArea`, `Toolbar`) in `@/components/ui/surfaces` that mirrors Libadwaita window panels and exports Storybook examples. _(Component stubs added under `src/components/ui`, Storybook stories still pending.)_
- [x] Replace Settings navigation with a proper `NavigationSidebar` component (icons + labels, active indicators) that collapses responsively and reuses the shared scaffold. _(Settings window now uses `Sidebar` + `NavigationSidebar` with toolbar header and mobile segmented control.)_
- [x] Refactor preference cards (Theme/Window Chrome/etc.) into a `PreferenceCard` pattern using subdued borders, meaningful headers, and consistent iconography; remove duplicated markup in `SettingsWindow`. _(General tab rebuilt using `PreferenceCard` + shared surfaces; legacy cards removed.)_
- [x] Harmonize button styles: create `SegmentedControl`, `PrimaryButton`, `TonalButton`, and `ToolbarIconButton` primitives with hover/focus states matching GNOMEâ€™s HIG; migrate all existing button clusters. _(Button variants refreshed to accent/tonal styles, toolbar icon button added, General tab now uses the new set.)_
- [x] Rebuild Quick Add and Search windows on top of the new scaffold, ensuring consistent padding, typography, and elevation; share component modules so they feel like siblings of Settings. _(Both windows now use `Toolbar`, `Surface`, and shared tokens; legacy `Pane`/`HeaderBar` removed and tests updated.)_
- [x] Centralize typography scale (Cantarell-compatible) via CSS variables (`--font-title`, `--font-body`); audit all headings/body text for weight/size mismatches and update Tailwind config accordingly. _(Global typography tokens added in `src/styles/globals.css`; Settings header + PreferenceCard/GeneralTab now consume `typography-*` utilities.)_
- [x] Simplify theming tokens: map Omarchy palette inputs to neutral/accent/outline roles, eliminate direct hex gradients in components, and validate accessible contrast automatically. _(Added canonical `--color-*` roles, updated palette application + contrast checks, and refactored globals to derive UI tokens from them.)_
- [x] Implement light/dark toggle synchronization and preview badges using the new component kit; ensure transitions respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. _(Added theme previews with system-aware badges, matchMedia synchronization, and motion-safe animations in `GeneralTab`.)_
- [x] Audit icon usage and swap to symbolic variants with consistent stroke weight; deliver as part of the component library and update asset imports. _(Search & Quick Add now use `CloseSymbolic`/`CheckSymbolic`, removing inline SVGs and standardising icons.)_
- [ ] Write integration tests (Playwright or React Testing Library) that verify layout integrity for Settings/Quick Add/Search under light, dark, and Omarchy palettes to prevent regressions.

# Integration & Rollout Tasks
- [ ] Migrate existing pages to the new design system incrementally, tracking progress in `docs/ui-migration-checklist.md` with screenshots before/after.
- [ ] Update README and `docs/linux-ui-ux-polish.md` to reflect the native design overhaul and provide guidance for contributors on using the new primitives.
- [ ] Collect user feedback on the revamped UI via Omarchy community channel; summarize findings in `docs/ui-feedback.md` and schedule follow-up iterations.
